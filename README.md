**Rheology data reader**  

This reader takes as an input excel (*.xls) files from viscosity and thixotropy measurements done with the TRIOS rheometer and returns plots and thixotropy analysis. To install the reader in your laptop clone the repository and create a *txt file named 'config'. in this file, add the path where the figures will be exported, for example C:\Users\JohnDoe\Documents\SlurryData\Figures.  
The file config.txt needs to be located where the main.py is located.
